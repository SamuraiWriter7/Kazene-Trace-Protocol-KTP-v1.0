# Kazene-Trace-Protocol-KTP-v1.0
Structural Attribution & Trace-Based Value Infrastructure

1. Overview

Kazene Trace Protocol (KTP) is a structural attribution framework designed for AI-era intellectual lineage tracking.

Unlike traditional copyright systems that bind rights to finished works, KTP tracks:

Structural origins

Conceptual lineage

Transformational flow

Impact propagation

KTP enables:

Transparent structural inheritance

Traceable idea evolution

Impact-based value distribution

Civilization-scale explainability

2. Core Principles
2.1 Structural Primacy

Value originates not from surface artifacts but from:

Question architecture

Concept topology

Logical scaffolding

Narrative frameworks

Decision structures

KTP treats these as first-class traceable entities.

2.2 Transparency over Ownership Absolutism

KTP does not aim to restrict knowledge flow.
It aims to make structural lineage visible.

2.3 Flow-Based Value

Value emerges from propagation and transformation, not static possession.

3. Core Components

KTP is composed of three fundamental layers:

3.1 Trace Origin (TO)

Represents the structural source point.

Attributes:

Origin ID

Creator Identifier

Timestamp

Context Metadata

Structural Signature

Purpose:
Establish a structural epicenter.

3.2 Trace Flow (TF)

Represents transformation and propagation.

Attributes:

Parent Trace ID

Transformation Type

Modifier Identifier

Timestamp

Diff Signature

Purpose:
Track lineage and mutation.

3.3 Trace Impact (TI)

Represents measurable influence.

Metrics may include:

Reference Count

Derivative Depth

Propagation Radius

Value Contribution Index

Purpose:
Quantify structural influence.

4. Data Model
4.1 Trace Object Schema (JSON Example)
{
  "trace_id": "KTP-0001-A7F3",
  "origin": {
    "creator_id": "user-001",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-16T10:00:00Z",
    "structure_signature": "sha256:9ab34e...",
    "context": "Structural rights framework proposal"
  },
  "flow": [
    {
      "parent_trace": "KTP-0001-A7F3",
      "modifier_id": "ai-node-003",
      "transformation_type": "conceptual_extension",
      "diff_signature": "sha256:bb8932..."
    }
  ],
  "impact": {
    "reference_count": 152,
    "derivative_depth": 4,
    "impact_score": 0.78
  }
}

4.2 Structure Signature

A structure signature may be generated from:

Abstract syntax representation

Graph topology hash

Semantic embedding fingerprint

Logical dependency mapping

Purpose:
Identify structural similarity beyond surface text.

5. Protocol Lifecycle
5.1 Registration

Origin structure defined

Signature generated

Trace ID issued

5.2 Reference & Derivation

AI or human references trace

Flow record appended

Diff signature recorded

5.3 Impact Evaluation

Periodic recalculation:

Impact Score = 
  α * ReferenceCount
+ β * DerivativeDepth
+ γ * PropagationDiversity


Parameters configurable by governance layer.

5.4 Value Mapping

Impact Score → Value Index

Connected to:

Royalty Distribution Engines

Trace Token Systems

Structural Credit Allocation

6. Governance Layer

KTP requires a meta-governance framework:

Trace Validation Authority

Signature Verification Layer

Fraud Detection Module

Conflict Resolution Protocol

Optional decentralized model supported.

7. Integration Modules

KTP is designed to interface with:

7.1 Royalty OS

Impact Score → Revenue Allocation

7.2 Decision OS (e.g., Manjushri OS)

Trace lineage informs explainable decision paths.

7.3 Civilization Transparency Layer

Provides:

AI decision ancestry maps

Structural genealogy graphs

Influence visualization tools

8. Security Considerations
8.1 Signature Forgery Prevention

Multi-hash validation

Semantic similarity cross-check

Topological verification

8.2 Trace Injection Attacks

Mitigation via:

Authority scoring

Anomaly detection

Structural entropy monitoring

9. Potential Extensions (v1.1+)

Dynamic Impact Weighting

Multi-AI Consensus Scoring

Structural Mutation Engine

Civilization-Scale Trace Graph

On-Chain Hybrid Implementation

10. Philosophical Position

KTP is not a restrictive intellectual property system.

It is a:

Structural transparency protocol

Civilization accountability layer

Idea lineage infrastructure

In the AI era, ideas evolve autonomously.

KTP ensures that structural ancestry remains visible.
